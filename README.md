# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb — a platform for booking accommodations. This educational project simulates real-world software development by integrating backend systems, databases, APIs, and DevOps practices.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand how to structure and manage a collaborative software project.
- Learn backend development using Django and MySQL.
- Apply best practices for API design and security.
- Practice CI/CD integration for automated deployment.
- Document software systems effectively.
- Gain experience working in distributed development teams.

### 🧰 Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API:** REST & GraphQL
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic of the application. It handles routing, request/response processing, and integrates with the database. Django also simplifies user authentication, admin interfaces, and ORM-based data access.

### 🐬 MySQL
A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data, such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and reviews. It works seamlessly with Django’s ORM for efficient data modeling and querying.

### 🔗 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It improves performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs. In this project, it's used to enhance API interactions between frontend and backend.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated units called containers. It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment stages.

### 🔄 GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool that automates testing, building, and deploying the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository. It helps maintain code quality and speeds up the development workflow.

### 🧪 Pytest (or Django's test framework)
Used for writing and running unit and integration tests to ensure that features behave as expected and regressions are caught early during development.

### 🌐 Git & GitHub
Version control tools used for managing source code, tracking changes, and collaborating with team members. GitHub also hosts the project repository and handles issue tracking and code reviews.

## 👥 Team Roles

### 🛠 Backend Developer
Responsible for developing server-side logic, implementing RESTful or GraphQL APIs, managing authentication and authorization, and integrating the backend with the database and frontend services.

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and maintains the MySQL database schema. Responsible for defining entity relationships, optimizing queries, ensuring data integrity, and managing backups and migrations.

### 🔐 DevOps Engineer
Implements CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Docker. Automates build, test, and deployment workflows to ensure consistent and efficient delivery across development stages.

### 🧪 QA Engineer
Writes and runs test cases (unit, integration, end-to-end) to validate application behavior. Detects bugs early in the development process and ensures that features meet the acceptance criteria.

### 📑 Documentation Lead
Manages all project documentation, including the README, API references, database schemas, setup instructions, and developer guides. Ensures information is up-to-date and clearly structured.

### 👨‍💼 Project Manager *(Optional)*
Coordinates team efforts, oversees task distribution and timelines, monitors project progress, and facilitates effective communication among team members to keep the project aligned with its goals.
